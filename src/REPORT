//my (Nitin's) part-
created the user_input() function, the function that controls how the players interact with the board, which has to perform various functions like
taking in inputs appropriately from the user, ensuring move validity, making sure that a player cannot play a non-jump move when he can make
a jump, ensuring that during multiple jumps only the same coin can be used, terminating the current move on the creation of a king,and correctly
giving players the opportunity to make multiple jumps when necessary by accordingly manipulating the transfer of control between players .
To accomplish these requirements, two separate functions were written, check_possible_jump, to check if a player can make a jump in his next turn, and
check_possible_jump_specific, which checks if a piece at a particular position has the possibilty to jump .
Created a mechanism to inform a player that they had lost when they had no valid moves to play, and a function check_if_player_lost was written 
to serve this purpose .
The workings of some of the implemented mechanisms are illustrated below-

Ensuring that a player must make a jump when he has the opportunity to-

//Pic 1

Awarding of multiple jumps to players-

//Pic 2

Ensuring the same coin must be used during a multiple jump-

//Pic 3

Automatically informing a player when they cannot make any more moves and have lost

//Pic 4

The data structure used was the double-dimensional array representing the checkers board .
Due to the board having fixed dimensions, the above functionalities and functions check_possible_jump, check_possible_jump_specific and Check_if_player_lost which
involve traversing the board or fixed squares around pieces, run in constant time .
